    <h1>This story is entirely fictional, and the places mentioned do not exist or have never been involved in the events of this story.</h1>
<h1>Chapter 1: Bad Starts</h1>
<p>
    1980s:
    In 1980, during the Cold War, the United States gathered the world's best scientists and established the "Nova Science Association." They began conducting tests to create the best super-soldier, starting with experiments on monkeys. When they found that the monkeys were stronger, they switched to testing on apes. However, the tests did not go well, and the adult apes became extremely aggressive and began to destroy their surroundings. Eventually, they escaped into the wild.
</p>
<h1>Chapter 2: A Good Life</h1>
<p>
    Year 2000:
    Following the end of the Cold War, the "Nova Science Association" was closed, and nothing much happened. The apes seemed to have died off, but their offspring were somehow smaller, less aggressive, and even a bit more intelligent than humans. This was great for the apes as they built small computers and somehow found out how to use the internet. They made tiny internet routers, and not many people knew how they worked without being plugged in.
</p>
<h1>Chapter 3: Discovered</h1>
<p>
    Year 2016:
    The apes were thriving and had abundant resources. They had almost infinite resources, and around this time, a researcher discovered them. The apes were so small that she almost stepped on them. She called the R.R.M.A. (Rescue and Research of Modified Animals), who placed the apes in a testing and habitable chamber. However, this chamber had illusions that somewhat played with the minds of the apes inside. Despite this unusual effect, the apes loved it. They would drop grapes, their favorite food, and all of them would gather to eat it. The researchers even gave the apes the tiny computers they had built in the 2000s.
</p>

    <h1>Chapter 4: adventure</h1>

    <p>
        In the year 2018 (present day ingame), the apes at the R.R.M.A. were doing well and had stopped being aggressive towards humans. They had also learned to speak English and Spanish, thanks to some Spanish-speaking employees who would occasionally teach them. However, one of the apes, Bill, felt sick and went to the mines to find a cure. He never returned and had turned into a monster. Some apes who went into the mines never returned, and flashlights did not work there, so the apes knew to stay away. One day, Charlie, a brave ape, went into the mines with a camera, microphone, flashlight, and rope on his back. He saw flashing lights and was in a forest, but it felt fake. He found some apes who had gone in before him, and they invited him to eat tacos. Charlie knew it was a trap and ran to the nearest air vent to hide. After crawling through the vents for hours, he found an exit sign with an orange glow, which led to a pit of fire and lava. He then found an entrance sign and was teleported back to the test chamber with his fellow apes.

    <h1>Chapter 5: Disruption</h1>

    <p>
        In the year 2019, the R.R.M.A. flooded the room with water to see how the apes would react. The apes could swim and loved water, but the R.R.M.A. received backlash from the public. A week later, the R.R.M.A. closed down, but instead of releasing the apes like the Nova Science Association did, they gave them to zoos. The Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens received the apes, but they did not test them. The apes liked testing, so they were given to the A.R.A.A., which pretended to test them but mostly left them alone. The A.R.A.A. gave the apes food, internet, and computers, but some of the effects of the things that the Nova Science Association gave to their parents turned some of the apes into monsters like Bill. The A.R.A.A. put them into the mines and locked it off.

    <h1>Chapter 6: The Cure</h1>
    <p>
        In the year 2021, many of the apes had turned into monsters. However, the Ape Alliance for Conservation and Protection (AACP) had been working on a cure for them. The cure worked within an hour, and the apes that had turned into monsters were cured. The AACP administered the cure to the rest of the apes, who were not monsters, and they were unaffected by the disease. The apes were thrilled to be healthy again, and no one ever bothered or tested them again. The AACP loved the apes and dedicated itself to teaching children about primates.

        The End.
